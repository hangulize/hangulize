Package hangulize transcribes non-Korean words into Hangul.

	"Hello!" -> "헬로!"

Hangulize was inspired by Brian Jongseong Park
(http://iceager.egloos.com/2610028). Based on this idea,
the original Hangulize was developed in Python and went out in 2010
(https://github.com/sublee/hangulize). Since then, serving as a web application
on http://hangulize.org/, it has been of great help for Korean translators.

This Go re-implementation is a reboot of Hangulize with feature improvements.

Pipeline

Hangulize transcribes with 5 steps. These steps include "Normalize", "Group",
"Rewrite", "Transcribe", and "Compose". To clarify these concepts,
let's consider an imaginary example of "Hello!" in English into "헬로!"
(actually, English is not supported yet).

First, Hangulize normalizes letter cases:

	"Hello" -> "hello!"

And then, it groups letters by meanings:

	"hello!" -> "hello", "!"

After that, grouped chunks are rewritten as source language-specific rules.
This step is usually for minimizing the differences between pronunciation
and spelling:

	"hello", "!" -> "heˈlō", "!"

And it transcribes rewritten chunks into Hangul Jamo phonemes.

	"heˈlō", "!" -> "ㅎㅔ-ㄹㄹㅗ", "!"

Finally, it composes Jamo phonemes to Hangul syllables and joins all groups.

	"ㅎㅔ-ㄹㄹㅗ", "!" -> "헬로!"

Spec

A spec is written by the HGL format which is a configuration DSL for Hangulize
2.  One spec is for one language transcription system.  So we need to describe
about the language at the first:

	lang:
	    id      = "ita"
	    codes   = "it", "ita" # ISO 639-1 and 3 codes
	    english = "Italian"
	    korean  = "이탈리아어"
	    script  = "roman"

Then write about yourself and the stage of this spec:

	config:
	    author = "John Doe <john@example.com>"
	    stage  = "draft"

We will write many patterns in rewrite/transcribe rules soon.  Some expressions
may appear many times annoyingly.  To not repeat ourselves, we can use
variables and macros.

A variable is a combination of letters.  Variable in pattern will match with
one of the letters.  Variable "foo" can be referenced with "<foo>" in the
patterns.

	vars:
	    "vowels" = "a", "e", "i", "o", "u"

A macro expression is replaced with the target before parsing the patterns. "@"
is the common macro for "<vowels>" variable:

	macros:
	    "@" = "<vowels>"

Now we can write "rewrite" rules.  There are Pattern and RPattern.  Pattern
matches with letters in a word.  RPattern represents how the matched letters
should be replaced.  A replaced word by a rule would become as the input for
the next rule:

	rewrite:
	    "^gli$"   -> "li"
	    "^gli{@}" -> "li"
	    "{@}gli"  -> "li"
	    "gn{@}"   -> "nJ"

Pattern is based on Regular Expression but it has it's own custom syntax.  We
call it "HRE" which means "Hangulize-specific Regular Expression".  For the
detail, see the documentation of Pattern.

"transcribe" rules are exactly same with "rewrite" rules.  But it's RPatterns
represent Hangul Jamo phonemes.  In contrast to "rewrite", a replaced word
won't become as the input for the next rules:

	transcribe:
	    "b" -> "ㅂ"
	    "d" -> "ㄷ"
	    "f" -> "ㅍ"
	    "g" -> "ㄱ"

Finally, we should write expected transcription examples.  They are used for
unit testing.  Verify your spec yourself:

	test:
	    "allegretto" -> "알레그레토"
	    "gita"       -> "지타"
	    "bisnonno"   -> "비스논노"
	    "Pinocchio"  -> "피노키오"
